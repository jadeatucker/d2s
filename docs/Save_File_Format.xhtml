<h1 align="center">Diablo II Save Game File Format</h1>
<h3 align="center">for Diablo II Expansion Set v1.13d</h3>
<div align="center">Updated July 1, 2012</div>
<p>This page was originally written by Trevin Beattie, whose site is no more (his latest version of this page is available
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070831101200/http://www.xmission.com/~trevin/DiabloIIv1.09_File_Format.shtml">here</a> though).<br />
Now this page is maintained by me, Yuri Sakhno (George1).</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This page describes the format of saved game files for the game Diablo II Expansion Set v1.13d.
While the information presented here is mostly aplicable to earlier versions of the game, there were some drastic
changes in version 1.10 (particularly, in how character stats are saved), so if you intend to read files of the versions
of the game erlier than that, you would probably be better off opening that save in some recent version of the game and
then saving it again (upgrading the saved game file).</p>
<p><i>(Note: all values larger than a byte are stored in x86 little-endian order &#x2014;
i.e., least significant byte first. A &quot;<tt>short</tt>&quot; is 2 bytes long,
and a &quot;<tt>long</tt>&quot; is 4 bytes long. Values starting with &quot;0x&quot; are given
in hexadecimal notation; otherwise they are decimal.)</i></p>

<h2>File Header</h2>
<p>Each save file starts with a file header. Depending on the circumstances, this may be the only section present in saved game file.</p>

      Duriel, Mephisto, and Diablo / Baal. There's a catch to that last
      one: in an Expansion game, the value is <em>not</em> incremented after
      killing Diablo, but is incremented by 2 after killing Baal. (The
      reason is unknown.) So it skips the values 4, 9, and 14.

<p>The header is followed by three structures, one for each difficulty level. Note that the byte
offsets given here are offsets into the structure; the first structure is at offset 345 in the file,
the second one is at offset 441, and the third one at 537. You have to add the offsets from the table
to these values to get the actual offset in the file for the corresponding field for the specific difficulty level.</p>
<p>Although there is some variation in the meaning of the bits per quest, some of the bits appear to have constant meaning.</p>
<p>Bit 0 indicates the quest is complete. If bit 0 is not set but the rest of the field is non-zero,
then the quest has been started, but not finished.</p>
<p>Bit 1 generally means you have completed the requirements for the quest
(i.e., killed the boss demon), and all that's left is to collect the reward &#x2014;
for example, &quot;Charsi will imbue an item with magical power.&quot; Not all
quests have this option. If this bit is set, bit 0 must be cleared.</p>
<p>Bit 2 is often set when an NPC gives you a quest.</p>
<p>Bit 12 is set when you have seen the swirling fire animation that closes a quest icon.</p>
<p>Bit 13 indicates the quest was completed in the current game; when you save
the game and then reload it, all bit 13's are cleared.</p>

<h2>Character Statistics</h2>
<p>The character statistics begin with 2-character identifier:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="10%">Byte Position</th>
    <th width="10%">Size</th>
    <th>Contents</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="middle">765</td>
    <td align="middle">2 <tt>char</tt>s</td>
    <td>The string identifier &quot;<tt>gf</tt>&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>From this point on, the contents of the file are variable, because character stats are stored in packed format
and certain stats may be absent (if the stat is absent in the save file, its value is 0.</p>
<p>Starting from patch version 1.10 Diablo II stores stats differently than it used to be in previous game version.
Every character stat is stored as a two-value pair. These pairs (and even the values inside them are not
byte-aligned. They may start in the middle of one byte, and continue to the second.
Here is the basic structure of the pair (note that field sizes are given in bits):</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th align="middle" width="10%">Field Size</th>
    <th align="middle" width="90%">Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td align="middle">9</td>
    <td>Stat Id. This field determines the stat whose value is stored in the value-pair and, more importantly,
      the size of the next field in the pair.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="middle"><i>variable</i></td>
    <td>The value that is to be assigned to the corresponding stat. The size of the field, in bits,
      is determined by the stat itself. Read on to find out where this information can be obtained.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The stats list is terminated by the 9-bit value of <tt>0x1FF</tt> (all 9 bits are set),
i.e. the entire list is read in a loop, where you read the Id first and, if that Id is <tt>0x1FF</tt>,
you exit the loop, otherwise you read the next <i>n</i> bits as a stat value and repeat the loop.</p>
<p>The Ids of stats (and sizes of values) are determined by the data-tables normally stored inside
the game archive (the MPQ files). The file for this specific purpose is named <tt>ItemStatCost.txt</tt>,
which is a kind of CSV file, but with tabulation characters used as separators instead of commas.
The game actually uses the <tt>ItemStatCost.bin</tt> one, which is sort of a compiled version
of the corresponding text file.</p>
<p>Here is an Excel-formatted <a href="ItemStatCost.xlsx">ItemStatCost.xlsx</a> file that contains
the data for 1.13d patch with some nice formatting and extra comments. This file actually contains
data from two tables, the one needed for the purpose of reading character stats is given on the <b>ItemStatCost</b> sheet.</p>
<p>The column <b>ID</b> specifies the Id of the stat, as stored in the 9-bit field of the two-value pair.
The row containing that Id describes the stat. There is a textual name of the stat in the <b>Stat</b> column,
as well as the size of the value, in bits, that follows the Id in the two-value pair. This size is specified
by the <b>CSvBits</b> column. Only values that have value <b>1</b> in the <b>Saved</b> column (first 16 stats)
are actually saved in the character stats section of the save file.</p>
<p>The stats described by the <b>ItemStatCost</b> table are as follows (in table below Stat Name corresponds
to the value in the <b>Stat</b> column from the data table):</p>

    <td>The number of Skill Choices earned but not distributed.

    <td>Current amount of Life points.
      <p><!-- @ --></p>
      <div>These 6 stats are (usually) always present. (There is
      an exception: if your character is dead, the current Life stat will be
      gone!) <u>They are also <i>not</i> plain integer values!</u>
      Instead, each field is a fixed-point binary number, with a 24-bit integer
      part and an 8-bit fraction part. For example, if the Current Life
      stat contains the value 0x020AC0, then to get the amount of life
      remaining you take that value and divide by 256.0 to get 522.75
      (rounding the number to an integer for display. Note that the
      current amount of Life, Mana or Stamina may be more than the base amount,
      because the base does not take into account any blessings bestowed by
      magical items you are carrying.</div></td>

      proportional to your level, at 10,000 gold per level. Thus, a new character can only
      carry 10,000 gold pieces, but a level 99 character (the maximum) can carry nearly
      a million in gold (990,000).</td>

      cap of 2,500,000 instead.</td>

<p>As it was specified above, the stats list is terminated with a stat Id with a special meaning
(the Id has value <tt>0x1FF</tt> in this case), and the stat value for this stat Id is not stored
(you may view it as a stat whose stat value is 0 bits in size). After that the remaining bits are
padded with 0-bits to the nearest byte-boundary so that the next section is byte-aligned.</p>

<h2><a name="skills">Character Skills</a></h2>
<p>The character skills section begins with the 2-character header,
&quot;<tt>if</tt>&quot;. This is followed by 30 bytes, each byte corresponding to
one of the character's special skills. To save space, Trevin listed the skills
in a <a href="Skills.html">separate table</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="item_list">Item List</a></h2>
<p>The next major section of the save file is the item list. It begins with the following header:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">Size</th>
    <th>Contents</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="middle">2 <tt>char</tt>s</td>
    <td>The string identifier &quot;<tt>JM</tt>&quot;.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="middle"><tt>short</tt></td>
    <td>The number of items your character has. This includes items
      equipped, tucked in your belt, stored in your inventory, stored in your
      stash, and hidden in the Horadric Cube. It does <em>not</em>,
      however, include gems, runes, or jewels which have been inserted into a
      socketed item. (Those are counted as part of the item.)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This header is followed by a list of items. The format of the items is described
on the <a href="Item_Format.xhtml">Item Format</a> page.</p>
<p>After the list of items, you will find another item list header similar to
the one shown above; only this time the item count will be either 0 or 1. The value 0
means that your character is currently alive. If the value is 1, then that means
your character is dead (if you load this save, a corpse will be lying at your feet in town),
in which case 12 bytes of <i>(unknown)</i> data will follow, after which there will be
another items list header (the one with the identifier &quot;<tt>JM</tt>&quot; and item count)
and item list for items on your corpse. Sadly, the meaning of the 12 bytes is unknown.</p>
<p>If you have an Expansion character, then the corpse item list (if there is one) will be
followed by the 2-character identifier &quot;<tt>jf</tt>&quot;. If <em>and only
if</em> you have a mercenary (alive or dead), this header is followed by an item
list header and (possibly empty) item list containing items equipped on the
mercenary. This item list is followed by the 2-character trailer &quot;<tt>kf</tt>&quot;.</p>
<p>If you have a necromancer, it is possible for you to have an Iron Golem that
is preserved when your game is saved and restored. The Iron Golem is based on an
item. Following the mercenary item list, there will be a single byte that is <tt>0x00</tt>
if there is no golem, or <tt>0x01</tt> if there is. If there is a golem, this byte is
followed by a single item.</p>
